### 🎯 Current Goals
1. 📝 Solve **100 LeetCode challenges** by June 30, 2025, and document my progress on GitHub.
       Why? To enhance my Python, SQL, and problem-solving skills.
2. 🏅 Complete **three Kaggle projects**, each with a corresponding **Power BI dashboard**, by June 30, 2025, documented on GitHub.
       Why? To continue to apply my skills to data-science related projects and to learn how to effectively use Power BI, which is a tool that wasn't used through my degree.
